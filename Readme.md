# VLQ-Parser

This project is a parser for VLQ numbers in JavaScript Sourcemaps, as described in [this](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/01/oxidizing-source-maps-with-rust-and-webassembly/#the-source-map-format) article regarding sourcemap parsing via rust and webassembly.

The primary goal was for me to try rust including some testing.

## Building

```
$ cargo build
$ cargo test
```

## What have I learned

* Basic Rust Syntax
* Usage of cargo for initializing project
* Usage of cargo for building and testing project
* Rust Unit Testing
* Rust Documentation testing
